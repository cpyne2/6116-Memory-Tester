This Arduino code can be used for testing 6116 SRAM memory modules.   It is designed to work with a LED sheild that ooutputs 8 LEDs showing the current address and 2 LEDs that indicate pass or fail.   The code can cycle though 256 addresses that make up a 6116 module in about 3.5 minutes.  Sheild kits for this project are available via the links below.
